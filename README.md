# From Folk to Google Contacts

Because [Folk App](https://www.folk.app/?) does not provide a way to export contacts compatible with Google Contacts...

Allow to transform a CSV export from Folk to a Google Contacts CSV import.

Pre-requisites:
- Nushell (https://www.nushell.sh/) `0.88` (Compatible with macOS, Linux and Windows)

## Usage

```bash
nu script.nu "folk_export.csv"
```
